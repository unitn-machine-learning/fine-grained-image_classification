  <h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>

  <p align="left">
    Fine-grained image classification is a challenging task in computer vision that involves distinguishing between very similar categories within a broader class. Unlike general image classification, where the goal is to categorize images into high-level categories (e.g., dogs vs. cats), fine-grained classification requires identifying subtle differences between subcategories (e.g., different breeds of birds).
    <br />
    <br />
    The motivation behind tackling fine-grained image classification stems from its significant potential to enhance various real-world applications. In wildlife monitoring, accurately classifying species can aid in conservation efforts by providing precise data on biodiversity. 
    In the medical field, fine-grained classification can improve diagnostic accuracy by distinguishing between similar-looking diseases. Despite its importance, fine-grained classification remains challenging due to the high intra-class variability and low inter-class variance, making it an intriguing problem for further research and development.
    <br />
    <br />
    This project aims to explore state of the art methods on Fine-Grained Classification and experiment with them on Benchmark and evaluation Datasets.
